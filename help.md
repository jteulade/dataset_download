If pip install requirement.txt doesn't works, check this :
    
    Download the installer from this website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
    Execute "chmod +x /path/to/the/script.sh" to give execution rights to the script
    Execute "bash SCRIPT_NAME.sh -b" -b: silent installation with default values
    Execute "source $HOME/anaconda3/bin/activate" to activate conda


For the username, when u created your account, go to Sentinels Hub and u can see your username on the top right. The password is the same as your account's password

 For every step, you need to use conda.
